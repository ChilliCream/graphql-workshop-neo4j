If you want to browse the GraphQL server head over [here]().

## Prerequisites

For this workshop we need a couple of prerequisites. 
First, we need the [.NET SDK 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

Then we need some IDE/Editor in order to do some proper C# coding, you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or if you have already on your system Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

Last but not least we will use our GraphQL IDE [Banana Cake Pop](https://chillicream.com/docs/bananacakepop).

> Note: When installing Visual Studio you only need to install the `ASP.NET and web development` workload.
